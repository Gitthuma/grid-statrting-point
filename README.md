Defining a grid

As a starting point, download and open the starting point file in your text editor and browser (you can also see it live here). You will see an example with a container, which has some child items. By default these display in normal flow so the boxes display one below the other. We will be working with this file for the first part of this lesson, making changes to see how grid behaves.
